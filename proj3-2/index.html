    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>

    <p>
        On the mirror material, the light from the the walls is reflected on the surface.
        Because light needs to go to the surface first and bounce back, it needs at least two bounces,
        which is why the mirror ball is mostly black until the bounce 2 image. 
        We do see light source reflection in bounce 1 image because light comes from bounce 0, 
        and bounce 1 only gives the reflection of light source.
        When bounce is sufficiently large, we can see the surrounding from the mirror ball, 
        because it has the effect of perfectly reflecting light coming from the surrounding.
        This perfect reflection allows us to see walls and the other ball on the mirror ball.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the glass material, it has properties of both reflection and refraction,
        but reflection is much weaker than refraction.
        As mentioned above, the glass ball it mostly black in bounce 1, except light source. 
        In bounce 2, we can see the reflection of the surrounding; however, 
        it is still very black because reflection is only a minor property for glass material, 
        and glass mostly bounces light through refraction. 
        Because refraction needs to have light first enter the material, 
        then bounces to another side inside the material, and then finally bounce out of the material,
        we can see that the glass ball is mostly black until the bounce 3 image. 
        In bounce 3 image, the light has bounced 3 times, so we can see it. 
        Because refraction is must brighter than reflection in glass material,
        we cannot really see the dark reflection from bounce 2 image any more. 
        When bounce is sufficiently large, we can see light is bent on the glass material. 
        The blue wall on the right side is displayed on the left side on the glass ball surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        For both materials, images bounce 4, 5, and 100 are roughly the same, 
        the light have pretty much gone through all parts of the scene. 
        It only makes the scene overall brighter,
         and red and blue colors from the wall are well mixed to the scene.

    <h3>
        Alpha Values
    </h3>

    <p>
        As alpha value goes down, the material becomes more shiny,
        and the colors from the surrounding is reflected from the material.
        In alpha = 0.005 and alpha = 0.05, we see that the gold material is overall shiny,
        and has red and blue colors from the walls reflected on the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        In alpha = 0.25, the surface is more diffusive. And colors from the wall are less obvious. 
        The color of the surface becomes more yellow, compared to the two cases above 
        that the materials tend to reflect the color of the surrounding. 
        In alpha = 0.5, it become very diffusive, and it tends to show its own yellow color.

    <h3>
        Sampling Method
    </h3>

    <p>
        When the sampling rate is fixed, 
        the bunny in the image of hemisphere sampling is much noisier than in importance sampling.
        This is because hemisphere sampling samples lights uniformly, 
        so it is less likely that the light sampled is useful for the given surface normal. 
        That's why the bunny looks more noisy and has random black dots. 
        Importance sampling the lights according to Beckmann distribution gives us samples that minimize the noise, 
        and useful parts in normal distribution function (NDF) are more likely to be sampled.
        So the image produced from importance sampling has less noises on the bunny.
